# Database-Development: College-B.D

***Database project developed in the Database Development subject taught by Professor Me. Márcio Cavalcante in the Systems Analysis and Development undergraduate program in 2024.***

Activity:

Import and export database.

Remove the current primary key from the "aluno_disciplinas_realizadas" table, as we will assume that the uniqueness of this entity will be guaranteed by the application (it will not allow duplicate records with id_pessoa X id_período X id_disciplina).

Create the "id" field in the "aluno_disciplinas_realizadas" table and make it the Primary Key (PK).

Create the "Notas" table, with the mentioned fields, including its PK (Primary Key) and FK (Foreign Key).

Populate the "aluno_disciplinas_realizadas" and "notas" tables with data (note that you will need to populate other tables as well).

Perform a SELECT query to retrieve all students and their respective average grades by discipline. Students without grades for the respective disciplines should also be displayed in the list as "NO GRADE."
